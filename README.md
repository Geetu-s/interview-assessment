# Interview assessment for QE candidates

Please clone this project and open it in your preferred IDE.

Once opened, navigate to the Feature File in this repo and write a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) style scenario in the Gherkin format. 

Think about whether there are any questions you might need to ask to gather more information, and how we can get full test coverage on the new feature. 

If you can, please then implement the code required to automate this scenario, in your language of choice (Java / JavaScript / Go / Python / etc).

If there is not enough time or there are technical issues, then please just explain and give examples of how you would automate the scenario.
